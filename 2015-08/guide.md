# CWDG: Autumn 2015
## *A Reference Guide*

### Preface

Previous semesters of CWDG have not proven to be terribly successful. Therefor, this guide is a radical step in a new direction. Also, this iteration of the guide expands from focusing solely on project to encompassing all of the club's activities.

### Meeting Format

Each meeting (after general club formalities) begins with a talk. To see the list of talks and who is giving them, consult the ["Projected Schedule" document](schedule.md). The talk is expected to last 45 minutes or less. After the talk, the non-mandatory exercise portion of the meeting will begin, which is described below.

### Talks

The talks for the Autumn 2015 semester will aim to cover more introductory topics. Specifically, the first meeting will cover HTML, the third will cover CSS, and the sixth will cover a very low level of JavaScript. At the end of each of these talks, additional resources will be listed so that members will know where to go to learn more. See the ["Additional Resources" document](resources.md) for the full list of resources.

### Weekly Exercises

Each week after the talk, the club will provide an exercise that members can do to experiment with the skills that they have learned from the talk. Wherever possible, these should be taken from Pair Columbus or other such organizations. Completing an exercise will be done in the Pair Columbus style, where the member will open a pull-request from their fork with their solution, and will, hopefully, receive feedback.

### Community

This semester, we are looking to include members from the community as much as possible. There are two roles that members of the community are open to take:
- Speaker - Simply sign up to give a talk.
- Mentor - Mentors should come to a few meetings, and work with students who need help completing the exercises.
