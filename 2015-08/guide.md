# CWDG: Autumn 2015
## *A Reference Guide*

### Preface

Previous semesters of CWDG have not proven to be terribly successful. Therefor, this guide is a radical step in a new direction. Also, this iteration of the guide expands from focusing solely on project to encompassing all of the club's activities.

### Meeting Format

Each meeting (after general club formalities) begins with a talk. To see the list of talks and who is giving them, consult the ["Projected Schedule" document](schedule.md). The talk is expected to last 45 minutes or less. After the talk, the non-mandatory exercise portion of the meeting will begin, which is described below.

### Talks

The talks for the Autumn 2015 semester will aim to cover more introductory topics. Specifically, the first meeting will cover HTML, the third will cover CSS, and the sixth will cover a very low level of JavaScript. At the end of each of these talks, additional resources will be listed so that members will know where to go to learn more. See the ["Additional Resources" document](resources.md) for the full list of resources.

### Weekly Exercises

Each week after the talk, the club will provide an exercise that members can do to experiment with the skills that they have learned from the talk. Wherever possible, these should be taken from Pair Columbus or other such organizations. Completing an exercise will be done in the Pair Columbus style, where the member will open a pull-request from their fork with their solution, and will, hopefully, receive feedback.

### End-of-the-Semester Hackathon

At the end of the semester, there will be an ultimate opportunity for students to prove their knowledge of what they've learned. The hackathon will begin noon on Saturday, November 28th and will conclude at approximately the same time on Sunday, November 29th, allowing for a full 24 hours of hacking. Teams should check in at 10:00 on Saturday. Teams participating must include at least one CWDG member, and must be, at most, four persons. Name tags will be given out to registered teams, allowing us to ensure that only the people who are supposed to be at the event are there. There will be an opening speech at 12:00, and hacking will officially begin at 13:00. Food for lunch and dinner on Saturday will be provided by the club, as well as an early-hours snack, breakfast, and lunch on Sunday. Following the end of hacking, judging will occur at 13:00 on Sunday. The finished projects are to be judged on functionality, originality, and user experience, rather than on their viability as a business. This will ensure that members will only be compared by what they should have learned from the semester of CWDG.

### Miscellaneous

As there seems no more pertinent section for this topic to be placed, it will be placed here: For the Autumn 2015 semester, we are moving to include more designers as well as developers. Visual design not only makes a product more attractive, it also increases usability and improves the user's experience. To help the products of CWDG to be better in these areas, we are looking to include the people who know visual design best: designers. However, designers will most likely not be interested in learning any information from the talks, so retention of designers in the club might prove to be difficult.

Additionally, we are looking to include members from the community as much as possible. There are three roles that members of the community are open to take:
Speaker - This is the least commitment role. Simply sign up to give a talk.
Mentor - Mentors should come to several meetings, and work with students who need help completing the exercises. Mentors will also be needed to help groups during the hackathon.
Judge - Judges are only required to show on the last day of the hackathon. Judges will listen to each presentation, and choose the top 3 groups.
