# CWDG: Autumn 2015
## *A Reference Guide*

### Preface

Previous semesters of CWDG have not proven to be terribly successful. This guide aims to be another iteration towards the perfection of the process. Also, this iteration of the guide expands from focusing solely on project to encompassing all of the club’s activities.

### Talks

The talks for the Autumn 2015 semester will aim to cover more introductory topics. Specifically, the first meeting will cover HTML, the third will cover CSS, and the sixth will cover a very low level of JavaScript. At the end of each of these talks, additional resources will be list so that members will know where to go to learn more. See the [“Additional Resources” document](resources.md) for a list of appropriate resources.

### Project Selection

As was noted in the Spring 2015 guide, club members seem unmotivated to work on student organization websites. This was somewhat reiterated in the feedback obtained, with the caveat of external organizations providing motivation to members in the form of trying to maintain a positive representation for the organization. Needless to say, this seems to be an imperfect solution, putting unnecessary pressure on members to build sites they are otherwise uninterested in building.
To remedy this, for the Autumn 2015 semester, it is proposed that the idea of creating student organization websites be replaced by member’s personal projects. At the second meeting of the semester, each interested member is given 2 minutes to pitch for their project idea. Pitches should have the form “I am trying to solve [problem] affecting [persons] with [solution].” This pitch format ensures the idea being pitched has a well-defined problem and a target audience.
After all interested individuals have pitched their ideas, the group as a whole will vote (having only one vote per member), and the most popular three projects will advance. Each project idea must be primarily web focused. Members are welcome to have their idea checked by an officer to ensure that it meets the specification for being “web-focused.” Of the projects chosen, at least one will be “beginner level.” This project should have a very basic back-end, if any. This will be the go-to project for new members.

**Rationale**: Club websites aren’t that interesting. Most clubs don’t need anything more than cookie-cutter static sites or CMSs. Club members’ ideas for projects are probably far more interesting, and the members whose ideas are chosen will most likely motivate their group in order to see their idea reach completion.

### Project Leader Selection

During the Spring 2015 session, project leaders were chosen from within their groups. This largely resulted in fairly appropriate leaders, and avoided the need for any fanfare around the process of choosing a leader. For the Autumn 2015 session, this is to remain the same.
During this first projects meeting, the Project Leader will collect member information (names and GitHub usernames). A list of the member's names and GitHub usernames will be due at the end of the first meeting. If a member does not have a GitHub account, they will be required to register one.

Project Leader Briefing

After the Project Leaders have been chosen, there is to be organized a meeting of the Project Leaders with the President, so that the President can review this guide with the Project Leaders and answer questions related to the roles of the Project Leaders.

### Prototyping and Design

*During the Spring 2015 session, many groups failed to produce much of anything during the prototyping, planning, and design phase. Feedback showed that many members felt that the period for prototyping, planning, and design was a void - just a delay in getting to “real work.” Not a single group did any user testing at all, which is odd in the face of its prevalence at other events (namely Startup Weekend). Some groups cited “not needing to do [testing] because it’s only a simple site.”
While this may be the prevailing opinion of members, it seems unreasonable to discard the prototyping and design phase in the face of it’s promise. In any event, the prevailing hope is that designers (see Miscellaneous section) will be interested in doing design. As there is no meaningful feedback for this section, it is remaining, and is unchanged.

On second thought, the most evolution of the design of projects happens once they’ve begun. It may be hard to get an idea of what a web app will feel like to use by only looking at a design - as was the case with the “snappy scrolling” idea of the Design Circle project from SP 2015. This period could be reconsidered to be, instead, fully defining the app conceptually (through user stories, perhaps). However, if there is no firm design, it will be difficult to have any expectation that the members of a project group will know how individual assignments fit together.*

Before any code is written for the website, each group needs to create a prototype of the full website. This prototype need not be functional or elegant; it can be illustrated on napkins, so long as it is understandable. The first several meetings should cover determining functionality, then wireframing (can be anything from illustrations on paper to InVision mockups and everything in between), followed by user testing.
User testing is likely the single most important task in the design phase. It consists of presenting a potential user with a task (e.g. Sign up for the mailing list) and presenting them with the mockups you have created. Without assistance, see why where they click to try and accomplish their task. Have the example user explain why they click on different items. As friend of the club Gina Winkler says, "ask why twice." When the user answers a question, repeat their answer back to them and then ask "why" about part of their answer. This method insures greater understanding of user behavior. CWDG members from other groups make excellent example users, though they are largely technical, and every CWDG member is encouraged to be part of the user testing for another group. Lastly, do not intend to stick with your original mockup. Iterate quickly, and changed to meet user feedback.

### First Development Meeting

The project leader will guide the project group in deciding the choice of the web technologies (language, framework, and database, if applicable) to be used on the project, and walk their group through the setup procedure. However, this is to only occur at this meeting. If any member is not present at that meeting they will be required to do this on their own. It would be beneficial if the group leader can locate an up-to-date, easily understandable tutorial for setting up the development environment, and distribute it to the members of the project group for ease of following along. A functional development environment is required for the second meeting.

### Meeting Format

Each meeting (after general club formalities) begins with a talk. To see the list of talks and who is giving them, consult the [“Projected Schedule” document](projected_schedule.md). The talk is expected to talk 45 minutes or less. After the talk, people interested in working on projects should stay, and the project half of the meeting will begin. This section of each meeting should begin with a group meeting, which, in industry, is called the "daily scrum meeting" or “stand-up meeting.” In this meeting, each member, in turn, describes what they have accomplished since the last meeting, what they intend to work on next, and if there is anything that they need help with in order to be productive. After this meeting, each member should begin working on their assigned ticket, and ask the project leader for a new ticket once their current ticket has been completed, reviewed, and merged. It is the responsibility of the project leader to review and merge pull-requests related to assigned tickets.

### Miscellaneous

As there seems no more pertinent section for this topic to be placed, it will be placed here: For the Autumn 2015 semester, we are moving to include more designers as well as developers. Visual design not only makes a product more attractive, it also increases usability and improves the user’s experience. To help our products be better in these areas, we are looking to include the people who know visual design best: designers. However, designers will most likely not be interested in learning any information from the talks, and are welcome to arrive at the start of the projects half of the meeting.

Additionally, for the Autumn 2015 semester the president and vice president will not participate in any particular project, but will instead moderate groups’ activities and work with individuals seeking help. Furthermore, mentors from the community will (hopefully) be present to work with groups.

Speaking of which, there are three roles that members of the community are open to take.
Speaker - This is the least commitment role. Simply sign up to give a talk.
Mentor - Mentors should come to several meetings, and work with project groups seeking help.
Judge - Judges are only required to show on the day of the Final Presentation. Judges will listen to each presentation, and choose the top 3 groups.
